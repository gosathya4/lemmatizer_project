"Every step you take today, no matter how small, brings you closer to your goals. Progress doesn’t always roar — sometimes it’s a quiet, steady push forward. Trust your journey, stay consistent, and believe in the power of your efforts. Great things take time, but with focus and determination, you’ll get there."
